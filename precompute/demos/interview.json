    },
    {
      "speaker": "James Park",
      "text": "Honestly, it was the tail latency. Getting P50 down is relatively straightforward, but P99 is a different beast. We had to redesign our partitioning strategy three times.",

      "end": 75.0
    },

      "speaker": "James Park",

    },

      "speaker": "James Park",

    },

    },

    {
      "speaker": "James Park",

      "speaker": "James Park",

    "summary": "Technical interview for a Senior Engineer position at Nexus, conducted by Sarah Kim (Engineering Manager) with David Cho (Senior Staff Engineer) on the panel. Candidate James Park demonstrated strong distributed systems expertise with 8 years of experience, including leading a real-time data pipeline processing 2M events/sec at Stratum. He delivered a solid system design for a notification system and showed strong coding philosophy around code reviews and chaos testing. A minor discrepancy was noted between his resume (12 engineers) and verbal statement (15 engineers), which he clarified as team growth. The panel decided to advance him to a follow-up interview with the VP of Engineering.",
